# GGMN Api

These are some notes I've collected about the GGMN api to help make integration go easily

## GET locations

equivalent to get resources:
- returns a list of "Locations", which needs to be formatted to Resources
- Paginated query, so we need to get all pages? There are >100,000 records, so I'm not sure the best way to do this...

- we may need to actually run this on the server and cache it - 

https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/locations

Paged query: /?page=4

example result:

```json
{
    "count": 106962,
    "next": "https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/locations/?page=5",
    "previous": "https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/locations/?page=3",
    "results": [

                    -20.554643,
                    0
                ]
            },

                "unique_id": "0a47a622e1f542ac9047a1dde9857f20",
                "users_url": "https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/organisations/0a47a622e1f542ac9047a1dde9857f20/users/"
            },
            "access_modifier": "Publiek",

            "ddsc_icon_url": null,
            "extra_metadata": null
        },
    ]
}
```


## Sign in

From what I can tell, GGMN uses basic auth, and simply adds the auth headers to each request. This means no session tokens, refresh tokens or anything of the like.

ref: https://ggmn.lizard.net/doc/api.html First section, Authentication

nienke.ansems
<PWD>

```
curl -X POST \
  https://ggmn.lizard.net/api-auth/login/ \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'username=nienke.ansems&password=<PWD>'
```

Got back session id: 444d1asw5i68jhzohbkb37fs0mwem0bk

So it looks like we get a sessionId cookie back, which we can use for all other requests later on. According to the docs, it has a 24 hour expiry, and doesn't have a refresh token, so we will need to hold onto the username and password

## Private resources

Based on the site, the only private resources I can see are in Iran.

format: min Lat, min Lon, max Lat, max Lon
BBox:
38.264440,45.635009,25.924174,61.769277
30.00,36.38591,50.00,56.51367 


## CSV Import docs (for reference)

https://ggmn.lizard.net/doc/import_screen.html?highlight=csv

The referenced units might also be helpful down the line: 
https://ddsc.lizard.net/api/v2/parameterreferencedunits/

## Get Readings

When we load the resource detail page, we need to get the last n readings from GGMN.

https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/timeseries/?end=1304208000000&min_points=320&start=1072915200000&uuid=93c6ff85-1661-4ce4-8671-926517eb797c

One location can have multiple timeseries? Yes. It appears that multiple parameters can be recorded in a single location.

This means that when we submit the reading, the user must select the parameter, and then we can set the timeseries accordingly


Location UUID -> Timeseries -> values?


How do we find the timeseries for the selected resource?



## Save Reading

we should use resources in IGRAC:
org id: a852f2e7bfe94e7c87e22927134ffead

eg. resource at:
52.92266,5.6967


For testing purposes, we will use:
- timeseries uuid: 8cd4eec3-1c76-4ebb-84e6-57681f15424f

```
POST https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/timeseries/8cd4eec3-1c76-4ebb-84e6-57681f15424f/data/
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

[{
    "datetime": "2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "value": 100
}]
```

Now we need to find the Groundwater station this is attached to.


1536227365000
1904208000000


## Making manual upload option:

- We __can__ upload files shapefiles (along with associated metadata) to create gw stations in GGMN. 
- Need to figure out the right format and way to save (eg. GeoJSON -> Shapefile -> .zip)

### Finding uploaded resources:

Shapefile contains Features. Features have an ID_1 field. Once it's been uploaded, it shows up as a "description" field in the search:

>https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/search/?q=1696&page_size=25
results:
```json
{
    "id": 624901,
    "title": "02.06.103",
    "description": "1696",
    "rank": 0.5,
    "entity_name": "groundwaterstation",
    "entity_id": 60061,
    "entity_uuid": null,
    "entity_url": "https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/groundwaterstations/60061/",
    "view": [
        41.95268570657572,
        -5.068848461502114,
        15
    ]
}
```

We can then use this entityId, and look up the associated groundwaterstation:

>https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/groundwaterstations/60061/
```json
{
    "url": "https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/groundwaterstations/60061/",
    "id": 60061,
    "timeseries": [],
    "filters": [
        {
            "url": "https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/filters/116509/",
            "id": 116509,
            "timeseries": [],
            "top_level": null,
            "filter_top_level": null,
            "filter_bottom_level": null,
            "aquifer_confiment": null,
            "litology": null,
            "high_groundwater_level": null,
            "low_groundwater_level": null,
            "code": "1696"
        }
    ],
    "scale": "wereld",
    "station_type": "basis",
    "status": "actief",
    "image_url": "",
    "code": "1696",
    "name": "02.06.103",
    "surface_level": 757.74799,
    "top_level": null,
    "bottom_level": null,
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
            -5.068848461502114,
            41.95268570657572,
            0
        ]
    }
}
```





The next challenge is that for some reason, we can't seem to find the timeseries associated with these uploaded resources. We need these timeseries Ids in order to upload the readings!


I managed to find the timeseries by clicking on the station in GGMN, and looking in the network log:
>https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/timeseries/?end=1541391219665&start=1509855219665&uuid=f3df7ae9-e3fb-449f-bda5-80c63bb7fabc

__We also need to be logged in to the same user that uploaded the files!__

            "supplier_code": null,
            "start": 1510358400000,
            "end": 1510444800000,
            "last_value": 100.65,
            "events": [
                {
                    "max": 697.65,
                    "min": 697.65,
                    "timestamp": 1510358400000
                },
                {
                    "max": 100.65,
                    "min": 100.65,
                    "timestamp": 1510444800000
                }
            ],
            "percentiles": []
        }
    ]
}
```

So this confirms that it exists, but we need to be able to find it based on the id of the feature in the shapefile: (eg. 1696)
For some reason, the timeseries location contains `1696` as code as well as name.

Let's try and find the timeseries based on the location__name:

>https://ggmn.lizard.net/api/v3/timeseries/?location__name=1696

__And it works!__

`results[0].uuid => f3df7ae9-e3fb-449f-bda5-80c63bb7fabc`

### Adding new readings: `POST /timeseries`
