<h1>MyWell – Terms and Conditions of its Use</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>MyWell is a smartphone app for collecting and analysing data related to depth to groundwater level, rainfall amount, checkdam water level and water quality parameters. The app was developed as part of the work in the MARVI project (www.marvi.org.in), and the idea of the app came from the need to help in crowdsourcing data from MARVI project's network of Bhujal Jaankaars (Hindi word meaning ‘Groundwater Informed’ volunteers). The app can now be used by anyone who is interested in collecting water data in any part of the world to better manage groundwater in their local area.
MyWell app is available free of charge. The app displays the current status of the groundwater level in each well, together rainfall amounts, checkdam water levels and water quality parameter values with historical and village level data for simple comparison and analysis.
The app is designed to be used by farmers, community groups, NGOs, schools and government agencies to help report groundwater and other related data and share them for the common good.  The data collected by the app can help in visualising groundwater levels, rainfall amounts, checkdam water levels and water quality trends and thus making ‘the invisible’ resource visible for better decision making and actions.  The data collected can be used for estimating the groundwater recharge following the rainfall event or rainy season.  The understanding developed through the analysis of the data can help in developing a common understanding groundwater resource and fostering cooperation among the local users of groundwater.
