<p>The GGMN App is powered by MyWell, which is a smartphone and SMS app developed in the framework of the MARVI<a href='https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/marvi/managed_aquifer_recharge_through_village-level_intervention'>(Managed Aquifer Recharge and Sustaining Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention)</a> project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR). In the MARVI, MyWell assists 'groundwater informed' volunteers, or Bhujal Jankaars (BJs) in the monitoring of groundwater levels, rainfall, checkdam water level and water quality in rural communities in India. More information about MyWell and MARVI in: <a href='http://www.marvi.org.in/home'>marvi.org.in</a></p><p>GGMN (Global Groundwater Monitoring Network) is a participative, web-based network of networks, set up to improve quality and accessibility of groundwater monitoring information and subsequently our knowledge on the state of groundwater resources. GGMN is a UNESCO programme, implemented by IGRAC (International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre) and supported by many global and regional partners.</p></br><strong>GGMN Portal</strong></br><p>The GGMN portal (<a href='https://ggmn.un-igrac.org/'>https://ggmn.un-igrac.org/</a>) assists in the spatial and temporal analysis of monitoring data and can be configured for your own organisation and projects. Data can be set to be private (only accessible for authorised users) or public.</p></br><strong>Join the network!</strong></br><p>If you would like to be part of the GGMN programme and make use of the GGMN portal together with the app, please contact us to <a href='mailto:info@un-igrac.org'>info@un-igrac.org</a> for more information or visit our <a href='https://www.un-igrac.org/ggmn'>website</a>.
