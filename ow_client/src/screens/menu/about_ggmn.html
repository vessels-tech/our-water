<p>GGMN (Global Groundwater Monitoring Network) is a participative, web-based network of networks, set up to improve
  quality and accessibility
  of groundwater monitoring information and subsequently our knowledge on the state of groundwater resources. GGMN is a
  UNESCO programme, implemented
  by IGRAC (International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre) and supported by many global and regional partners.

<strong>GGMN Portal</strong>
</br>
<p>The GGMN portal (<a href='https://ggmn.un-igrac.org/'>https://ggmn.un-igrac.org/</a>) assists in the spatial and
  temporal
  analysis of monitoring data and can be configured for your own organisation and projects. Data can be set to be
  private (only
  accessible for authorised users) or public.

<strong>GGMN and MyWell</strong>
</br>
<p>
  The GGMN App is powered by MyWell, which is a smartphone and SMS app developed in the framework of the
  MARVI <a
    href='https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/marvi/managed_aquifer_recharge_through_village-level_intervention'>(Managed
    Aquifer Recharge and Sustaining Groundwater Use through Village-level Intervention)</a> project funded by the
  Australian Centre
  for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR). In the MARVI, MyWell assists 'groundwater informed' volunteers,
  or Bhujal Jankaars (BJs) in the monitoring of groundwater levels, rainfall, checkdam water level and water quality
  in rural communities in India. More information about MyWell and MARVI in: <a
